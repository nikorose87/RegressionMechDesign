abstract = {​This book aims at illustrating strategies to account for uncertainty in complex systems described by computer simulations. When optimizing the performances of these systems, accounting or neglecting uncertainty may lead to completely different results; therefore, uncertainty management is a major issues in simulation-optimization. Because of its wide field of applications, simulation-optimization issues have been addressed by different communities with different methods, and from slightly different perspectives. Alternative approaches have been developed, also depending on the application context, without any well-established method clearly outperforming the others. This editorial project brings together — as chapter contributors — researchers from different (though interrelated) areas; namely, statistical methods, experimental design, stochastic programming, global optimization, metamodeling, and design and analysis of computer simulation experiments. Editors' goal is to take advantage of such a multidisciplinary environment, to offer to the readers a much deeper understanding of the commonalities and differences of the various approaches to simulation-based optimization, especially in uncertain environments. Editors aim to offer a bibliographic reference on the topic, enabling interested readers to learn about the state-of-the-art in this research area, also accounting for potential real-world applications to improve also the state-of-the-practice. Besides researchers and scientists of the field, the primary audience for the proposed book includes PhD students, academic teachers, as well as practitioners and professionals. Each of these categories of potential readers present adequate channels for marketing actions, e.g. scientific, academic or professional societies, internet-based communities, and authors or buyers of related publications.​},

@article{Hansen2016,
abstract = {This chapter describes mechanical properties of prosthetic feet and their effects on level gait of persons with amputations. These descriptions focus on recent literature and knowledge gained from controlled studies of different properties including stiffness/flexibility, damping, roll-over characteristics, active push-off in late stance phase, and toe clearance during swing phase. The chapter also discusses future directions in prosthetic foot research, including the need for both amputee-independent measurements combined with clinical trials. Specific approaches to future studies of prosthetic feet are proposed that could further our knowledge base and ultimately lead to improved prescription of prosthetic feet for persons with amputations.},
