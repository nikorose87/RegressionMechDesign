    "Regression tasks in Artificial Intelligence are not common, they are being used in fields as Finance, Surrogate Modelling \\cite{Forrester2008} and Sensitivity Analysis \\cite{Iooss2015}. This time your work will be focused on design, especifically, design of transtibial (Ankle-foot) prosthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Design Variables in prosthesis have been studied along decades. Those variables can be grouped in the following according to \\cite{Hansen2016}:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Siffness/Flexibility.\n",
    "- Damping.\n",
    "- Roll-over characteristics\n",
    "- Active push-off in late stance phase\n",
    "\n",
    "The half part of the course will do the design focused on the prosthesis stiffness, in other words, variation of the thickness along the laminates.The other half of the course will be focused on the Roll-over characteristics, this is achieved with variations in the prosthesis shape.\n",

    "## Design for thickness\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was explained, there are two datasets, those are simulations already performed with a Latin Hyper Cube (LHS) experiment \\cite{Helton2003} design. The first one is about the influence of the thickness variation with respect to the outputs. For thickness 120 simulations were run, varying the thickness on different locations of the prosthesis. The following figure \\ref{fig:thickness} explains how thickness is being varied along the device. In total, there are twelve dimensions as features for the dataset.\n",

On the other hand, SVM is able to predict values higher than the bounds, however scaling the data is needed to provide coherent results. (40% of the grade)\n",

Compare the results and give conclusions. (20% of the grade)\n",

For instance, you can set a [meshgrid](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36013063/what-is-the-purpose-of-meshgrid-in-python-numpy) with numpy and predict all possible configurations, later you can filter the best. After that, compare if you have obtained higher values for the goals and preserving the constrains. (10% of the grade)\n",
